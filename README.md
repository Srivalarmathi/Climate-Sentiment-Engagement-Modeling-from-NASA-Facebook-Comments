# Climate Sentiment & Engagement Modeling – NASA Facebook Comments

This project analyzes public sentiment and engagement patterns from NASA’s climate-related Facebook posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP), topic modeling, and predictive analytics. The goal is to uncover how audiences respond emotionally to climate content and provide strategic recommendations for science communication.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: 10,000+ Facebook comments from NASA’s climate posts
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Power BI
- **Key Techniques**: Sentiment Analysis, NMF Topic Modeling, Isolation Forest, Regression Modeling

## 📊 Objectives

- Classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) across user comments
- Identify dominant climate-related topics using unsupervised learning
- Predict engagement metrics such as likes and replies
- Detect anomalies in comment behavior to flag viral or controversial posts
- Visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard

## 🧠 Methods

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Used polarity scoring to classify emotional tone
- **Topic Modeling**: Applied Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to extract five key themes
- **Engagement Prediction**: Built regression models to forecast likes and replies
- **Anomaly Detection**: Used Isolation Forest to identify unusual comment patterns
- **Dashboarding**: Designed Power BI visuals for sentiment trends, topic breakdowns, and user profiling

## 📌 Key Findings

- Negative sentiment dominates most climate topics, especially around sea level rise and carbon emissions
- Planetary trends show balanced sentiment and high engagement, ideal for strategic messaging
- Anomalies often correlate with misinformation or emotionally charged language
- Predictive models achieved strong performance in forecasting likes and replies
